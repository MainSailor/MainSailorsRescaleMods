//Might be cheaty, but adding a gimbal makes these far more tolerable for long Duna Injection burns. The on-board RTG follows other third-party nuclear engines in providing some power from the nuclear core. Will need to update to use coreheat mechanics eventually, but haven't broken into that quite yet.
